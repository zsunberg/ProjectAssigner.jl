Tool for assigning students from a large class (e.g. Senior Design) to projects based on their preferences, skills, and small friend groups that can be used via [Julia](https://julialang.org/) or Python through [pyjulia](https://github.com/JuliaPy/pyjulia).

Please see the documentation by clicking on the blue docs badge above for instructions and usage.

More details about the approach can be found in our [ASEE conference paper](https://peer.asee.org/37187).

This tool was originally developed for the senior design course in [Aerospace Engineering Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/people).
