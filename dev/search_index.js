See the Data Format section of the documentation for more information.\nprojects: A DataFrame or csv filename String specifying information about the projects. See the Data Format section of the documentation for more information.\noutput::String: optional name for a csv file that the assignments will be written to.\nforce: optional vector of student-project pairs to force matches for, e.g. force=[\"Bob\"=>\"Airplane\"] will force student Bob to be assigned to the Airplane project.\noptimizer: A subtype of MathOptInterface.AbstractOptimizer to run the optimization, e.g. optimizer=Gurobi.Optimizer will use Gurobi instead of the default GLPK\n\nwarning: Scaling Issues\nDue to the exponential costs in the objective, the optimization problem may be poorly-scaled for large classes. This can result in the default GLPK optimizer producing poor results even though it thinks that it has solved the problem. More powerful commercial solvers such as Gurobi can handle this much better.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"data/#Data-Format","page":"Data Format","title":"Data Format","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"CurrentModule = ProjectAssigner","category":"page"},{"location":"#ProjectAssigner","page":"Home","title":"ProjectAssigner","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Documentation for ProjectAssigner.
